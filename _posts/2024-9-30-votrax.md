*UNIX: A History and a Memoir* is a great book to read. The book mentions a program called "[Votrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax)" that can speak the text you typed.

I had just got my Raspberry PI at that moment, and I decided to write a simple program that can do the similar thing.

And [this](https://github.com/cuckon/votrax) is my implementation. It uses the following techniques:
- Python
- fastapi
- TTS by Azure

So once anyone visit `<domain>/v1/some-thing`, it will "say" "some thing" through the speak of my Raspberry PI.
