I was planning to start personal project of "Asymmetric Competitive Game". One of characters is a hen.

## Blender

The modelling and skinning was done in Blender. It was a fun experience but I quickly find it's data communication with Unreal Engine is a mess (like the joint axis). So I take it into Maya for further editing.

## 3D Print

Since I had gone this far, I couldn't helping thinking that maybe I can 3d print it to make it more interesting. And turned out it's a big succuss! I really like it!

## Using it in UE

I decided to rig it totally with UE.

UE was an Engine but right now Epic is mixing the boundary of it with DCC.

Here are couples of test:
- [ControlRig Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiPb0PypwI)
- [Chicken head stabilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxMt4_a3HoI) This is my favourate! It really distinguishes ControlRig from traditionall DCC rig like Maya.
- [My PartyAnimals-like implementation](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nW421N7vQ/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=045ce34fc7fb069bf01c6f6216b74fb9)

I and managed to make [several tutorials(in Manderian)](https://space.bilibili.com/514800845/channel/collectiondetail?sid=2118980) for Controlrig.

ControlRig is very efficient - both in developing stage and runtime stage. Although I've been using maya for 15 years, I am really not a fan of Maya rig, due to Autodesk's subpar upgrades. In some aspects, UE now offers a superior user experience in rigging, surpassing Maya's historical strengths.
